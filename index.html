           Hi! I'm Tricia. I am a Research Scientist at <a href="https://teachfx.com">TeachFX</a> and a NSF STEM Education Postdoctoral Fellow in the <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/">Human-Computer Interaction Institute</a> at Carnegie Mellon University. As a cognitive and learning scientist, I take an interdisciplinary approach to my research, using methods and theories from psychology, human-computer interaction, and learning science to design tools for personalized professional development and feedback. <b>Ultimately, my vision is for technologies that create equitable learning experiences across formal, informal, and professional learning environments</b>.
          <br><br>
           I received my PhD in Cognitive Science at UC San Diego in the <a href="https://designlab.ucsd.edu/">Design Lab</a>, where my dissertation examined interactive strategies and tools to support exploratory thinking in creative work. Before that, I graduated from UC Berkeley with Honors in Psychology. Outside of work, I enjoy attempting to exercise through boxing, being mediocre at video games, meddling on the piano, and volunteering as a "cat cuddler" at the Humane Animal Rescue of Pittsburgh! 
        <!--   <p class="mb-5">Hi! I'm Tricia. I am a Research Scientist at <a href="https://teachfx.com">TeachFX </a>.

Ultimately, my vision is for technologies that create equitable learning experiences whether that's in formal educational institutions, informal learning environments, or professional learning settings.

          <h3 class="mb-5">Multi-modal Analytics Tools for Personalized & Contextual Professional Feedback</h3>
            <p class="mb-0">Professional development in fields where interactions with people are critical for professional success is often impersonal and infrequent. In this project, we collaborate with researchers, professionals, faculty, and K-12 teachers to design tools to scale human obervation and provide automated multimodal analytics through ubiquitous sensing systems in the classroom and workplace. My work aims to understand perceptions and impact around these systems, particularly with regards to ethical AI, privacy, and social dynamics.</p>

          <p class="mb-0">Teachers in low-infrastructure contexts face challenges related to technology, economic, and environmental infrastructure. In this project, we designed a social media-based chatbot to help teachers in rural C<span>&#244;</span>te d'Ivoire get quick, automated guidance and facilitate communication within their communities of practice.</p>

          <h3 class="mb-5">Adaptive Guidance Tools for Supporting Exploratory Thinking in Creative Work</h3>
          <p class="mb-0">In any creative domain, novices have difficulty exploring the potential space of possibilities because they don't yet have the domain knowledge to know <i>what</i> to explore nor the procedural knowledge to know <i>how</i> to explore. For my PhD dissertation, I studied strategies to help scaffold novices in exploratory thinking and implemented these strategies within creativity support tools.</p>
