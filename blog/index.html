          <h2 class="mb-5">October 6, 2020</h2>
            <h3 class="mb-5">Research/Academic</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>A new quarter just started. I'm now in my 6th year of my Ph.D! That also means that this is my final year, and with all the uncertainty surrounding the job market (and the world, in general), the question I always get of "What are you going to do after you graduate?" induces even more anxiety than ever. But it also means that the light at the end of the tunnel is within reach!</li>

                <li>I'm a teaching assistant for <i>Design of Everyday Things</i> this quarter. This is my 5th time TA-ing this course! This quarter should be extra fun because I'm leading a team of undergraduate instructional assistants with my own roommate who is also a cogsci Ph.D student. I'm hoping to pass the torch to him after I graduate so the legacy of a great class can continue on.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>I think there will definitely be some challenges to running an interactive, studio-based course fully remote, but there are also plenty of opportunities to give students an enriching and engaging experience with the affordances of online tools!</li>
                </ul>

                <li>I finished up a 2nd summer internship at Adobe Research, working again with Joy Kim!</li> 
                <ul>
                  <li>I had a great experience even though everything was remote. We worked on a project looking at human-AI collaboration in the domain of comics, which is perfect because of my own interest in drawing comics! It was a busy, productive, and fun summer, and we were able to manage a CHI submission at the end of it.</li>
                </ul>

                <li>This year I'll be working on a few projects:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>A project examining how exploratory and exploitative thinking affect creative outcomes.</li>
                  <li>A project with preschool-aged children investigating how exploration can facilitate pattern learning.</li>
                  <li>Resubmitting my internship project from last year looking at how abstracting visual elements of something like a drawing can draw focus to high-level concepts rather than low-level detail.</li>
                </ul>

                <li>For my job search, I've started doing the cold emails and searching for postdoc funding fellowships/grants. It's daunting to just email someone out of the blue, but I mainly see it as opportunities to just talk about my research.
                <ul>
                  <li> Some exciting news on that front! I'm excited to be doing a virtual visit to the University of Wisconsin, Madison where I'll be giving a talk and meeting with other faculty members and grad students later this fall! I was supposed to go visit in-person in the spring, but you know, COVID happened...</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <br>
            <h3 class="mb-5">Personal</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>I picked up lots of hobbies this summer! After all, what else is there to do during quarantine?</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>I've lived in San Diego for 5 years, and I finally got a surfboard and wetsuit! I'm still very bad at surfing, but it's nice to just be in the water and sun. I also put my prototyping skills to use in developing a make-shift surfboard strap because my arms are too short to hold the surfboard on its own.</li>
                  <li>I bought a keyboard to start practicing piano again! I was mostly self-taught as a kid, but I haven't practiced since leaving home for college. I've really enjoyed playing again and learning to play some of my favorite songs. What I love about playing music is that it's a fantastic solo activity that doesn't involve screens, and the payoff for practicing is super rewarding.</li>
                  <li>I miss going to the boxing gym, but my quarantine pod and I have been regularly going to the park to practice boxing drills, which has been keeping me from being a couch potato.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>I also got a Nintendo Switch this summer! After months of not being able to find one for a reasonable price, I was finally able to obtain one so needless to say, most of my evenings have been spent on the Switch.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>I was finally able to hop on the Breath of the Wild and Animal Crossing band wagons! My favorite part of Animal Crossing has been making cute outfits and appearance combinations!</li>
                  <li>I've also been obsessed lately with Supergiant Game's Hades! I've died many times, but I'm constantly impressed with the replayability and seemingly infinite plot progression and character development!</li>
                  <li>I also got the Ring Fit to make working out feel more like a game! I was skeptical about fitness video games, but it's actually been super fun, especially since I've been able to turn it into a social activity.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>I made some great progress in leisurely reading as well. Here are the books I've read and enjoyed this summer as well as my in-progress reads:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li><i>The Sandman</i> by Neil Gaiman</li>
                  <li><i>Born a Crime</i> by Trevor Noah</li>
                  <li><i>The Myth of Sisyphus</i> by Albert Camus</li>
                  <li><i>How to Ruin Everything</i> by George Watsky</li>
                  <li><i>One More Thing</i> by B.J. Novak</li>
                  <li><i>Watchmen</i> by Alan Moore (in progress)</li>
                  <li><i>Dune</i> by Frank Herbert (in progress)</li>
                </ul>
